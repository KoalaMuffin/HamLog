# HamLog. Coming March 10.
HamLog is a work in progress software I am developing for logging ham radio contacts. It will use <a href="https://electronjs.org">Electron</a>. It is my first project with this framework. You can see an image of how it looks so far below.

Want to try it out?
Download and install the files:
<pre>
sudo git clone https://github.com/KoalaMuffin/HamLog.git
cd HamLog
npm install
npm start
</pre>
Electron requires NodeJS and NPM, I believe.
